            <p>I was born and spent my early life on the Western shore of MD
                    I was rarely in one spot for so<br> long. I take much pleasure in creative, erratic and engaging activities but I also love to balance<br>
                    with unique relaxtion methods. Some of these include a passion for motorsports, other extreme<br>
                    sports, art, numbers, technology, exploring nature and cities, plus more.<br><br>
                    When I think about what my ideal career would be I pay attention to the fact that     
                    I am a naturally<br>
                    restless and dynamic personality who needs a variety of stimulation, I would have a main focus,<br>
                    a side project, and a passion, one where I am able to actively travel often as well.<br><br>
                    I reside currently in Central Florida, my first time away from a coast. Good thing Florida is a thin<br>
                    state.. I am interested in coding and development because it started off when I was in eighth<br>
                    grade, coding is one of the subjects I've been most committed to long term while enjoying doing so.<br><br>
                    We are apart of a society that has been transitioning from the Industrial Era to the Digital Age which<br>
                    I can absolutely see and be sure I am apart of this progression with ease and enjoyment. My most
                    piqued interest is in blockchain<br>
                    technology.</p>
